  <h1 class="title">Stop Wasting Time Online</h1>
  <p>Why are you wasting time reading other people's crap online?</p>
  <p>Research <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/05/ff_nicholas_carr/all/1">has shown</a> that the constant array of tiny interruptions the modern web imposes on us through services like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are rewritting our brains.</p>
  <div id="app"></div>
  <p><strong>You only get so much time to hang out down here</strong>, don't waste too much of it. Tiny distractions add up to big chunks of time. Make the most of what you have left, go make something.</p>
</div>

<script id="timeLeft-template" type="text/x-handlebars-template">
  <section class="timer">
    <h2 class="timeLeft-label">Your time left today:</h2>
    <h2 class="count">{{timeLeft}}</h2>
  </section>
      <!-- <p>We're wired for distractions—it's an evolutionary adaptation from when noticing things like a twig snapping in the distance could save your life. Today, every little Tweet, cat photo, or Facebook poll, taps into that same evolutionary mechanism—delivering a nice shot of dopamine to keep you coming back, and undermining your ability to focus, ignore irrelevant information, process past experiences, and get stuff done.</p> -->
